# NetDB: Easy database management endpoints

NetDB is a very easy safe and secure solution to expose your database endpoints out to the real world. It is optimised for Roblox, with a provided Module and example script to make managing your database easy.

## Getting started

```bash
# Install MariaDB
sudo apt install mariadb
sudo mysql

# Create your database
create database YOUR_DATABASE_NAME;

# Create database user
CREATE USER 'NetDBClient'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON YOUR_DATABASE_NAME.* TO 'NetDBClient'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;

# Clone repo & install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/linuskangsoftware/netdb
cd netdb
npm install
```

Create a ``.env`` inside ``/netdb``

```
PORT=3000

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=NetDBClient
DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
DB_NAME=YOUR_DATABASE_NAME

API_KEY=your_super_secret_api_key_here
```

Start the server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now you have your database & backend fully setup. If your not using a cloud service to host, you will need to port forward your webserver to the open world. I prefer to use ``Cloudflared`` and Zero Trust on cloudflare for this.

After that, import the javascript module and example script and follow the api docs there.
